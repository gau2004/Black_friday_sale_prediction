# Black_friday_sale_prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer purchases during Black Friday sales using machine learning techniques. After loading and exploring the dataset, data preprocessing was conducted to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data. Various visualizations were created to identify patterns and relationships between features, such as the impact of gender, occupation, and product categories on purchase behavior. The project employed several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Random Forest was chosen as the final model due to its ability to reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy through ensemble learning. The model's real-world applications include assisting retailers in optimizing inventory, tailoring marketing strategies, and predicting sales trends during large-scale events like Black Friday. Finally, the predictions were exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
